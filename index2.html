                    <li>In today’s busy world, no one likes wasting hours in crowded waiting rooms at the doctor’s clinic. 
                        That’s where DoctorRoom’s comes in — a smart web platform designed to make visiting your doctor simpler and faster.</li>
                    <li>When patients usually visit a doctor, they often spend a lot of time waiting for their turn because of other patients ahead of them.
                         DoctorRoom’s solves this problem by letting patients know exactly when their turn is likely to come. 
                        For just $1, patients get real-time updates on the queue, so they can better plan their visit, avoid unnecessary waiting, 
                        and use their valuable time elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>DoctorRoom’s isn’t just about saving time — it’s about making healthcare visits more efficient, stress-free, and patient-friendly.</li>
